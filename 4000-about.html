                <p>THINK-A-HEAD GAMES can trace its origins back to the 1800s
                where the Kingston family taught how to play chess at their
                private school. Young members from prominent families all across
                Europe and America came to be students at this school in New
                England.</p>
                <p>The founder of THINK-A-HEAD GAMES, Andrew Dufresne, the son
                of a prominent stonemason, was a particularly gifted student.
                With his new-found love for the game of Chess, Andrew Dufresne 
                went on to start making his own business of selling board games 
                in 1948. While he was getting by with his business, he was
                always feeling something was lacking. It was one day that he
                began to hear from several of his customers that they are not
                satisfied with the standard chess sets that the big gaming
                industries seem to put on the market. To them these standard
                Chess sets did not have any feeling to the design that went into
                creating them. It was at this moment that Andrew Dufresne came
                up with the idea of THINK-A-HEAD GAMES.</p>
                <p>Andrew Dufresne then combined his talent for crafting things
                with his love for Chess and sold his board game shop to 
                completely pursue his passion to create custom made chess sets 
                for customers. He passed his passion on to his step-son, BObert 
                Fisher, who is the owner and CEO of the THINK-A-HEAD GAMES we
                know and love today</p>
                
                <h1>A brief history of Chess</h1>
                <p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years, 
                although the earliest origins are uncertain. The earliest 
                predecessor of the game probably originated in India, before the
                6th century AD; a minority of historians believe the game
                originated in China. From India, the game spread to Persia. When
                the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim 
                world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe. In Europe, 
                chess evolved into roughly its current form in the 15th century.</p>
                
                <h1>Other games like Chess</h1>
                <h3>Shogi</h3>
                <p>Shogi, also known as Japanese chess or the Generals' Game, is
                a two-player strategy board game in the same family as chess,
                chaturanga, makruk, shatranj, janggi and xiangqi, and is the
                most popular of a family of chess variants native to Japan.
                Shōgi means general's board game. The earliest predecessor of 
                the game, chaturanga, originated in India in the 6th century. 
                Shogi in its present form was played as early as the 16th 
                century, while a direct ancestor without the drop rule was
                recorded from 1210 in a historical document Nichūreki, which is
                an edited copy of Shōchūreki and Kaichūreki from the late Heian
                period (c. 1120).</p>
                <h3>Chaturanga</h3>
                <p>Chaturanga, or catur for short, is an ancient Indian strategy game which is commonly 
                theorized to be the common ancestor of the board games: chess,
                shogi, sittuyin, makruk, xiangqi and janggi.Chaturanga developed
                in the Gupta Empire, India around the 6th
                century AD. In the 7th century, it was adopted as shatranj in
                Sassanid Persia, which in turn was the form of chess brought to 
                late-medieval Europe.
                The exact rules of chaturanga are unknown. Chess historians
                suppose that the game had similar rules to those of its 
                successor shatranj. In particular, there is uncertainty as to 
                the moves of the Gaja (elephant).</p>
