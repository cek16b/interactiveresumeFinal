            <h2>Plastic Chess Sets</h2>
            <img src="4000-images/plastic.jpeg" alt="Plastic example">
            <p>o	Try out our new plastic line of Chess Sets. Every plastic 
            chess set is made from hand molds. We at Think-A-Head games are big 
            supporters of environmental protection and have made the plastic
            molding of our chess sets as environmentally friendly as possible.</p>
            <h2>Wooden Chess Sets</h2>
            <img src="4000-images/walnut.jpeg" alt="Wooden example">
            <p>o	All woods used for our chess sets are responsibly sourced
            from local business tree farms. The wood is carefully sanded,
            treated and polished, to last for a long time. Our customers have a
            choice between two sets. The first, and most popular, are our Walnut
            and Maple sets. The Walnut wood makes up the Black squares and Black
            pieces. The Maple makes the White squares and White pieces. Our
            second type of Chess set is our rosewood set. Both colors of this
            side have more of a reddish hue. All of our chess sets are boarded
            in a yew wood finish.</p>
            <h2>Glass Chess Sets</h2>
            <img src="4000-images/glass.jpeg" alt="Glass example">
            <p>We are so passionate about our work here at Think-A-Head 
            Games that we have learned how to shape glass in Italy just to offer
            our customers a better product. One side of the board is made from a
            clear glass, while the other side is made from a smoky glass.</p>
            <img src="4000-images/marbleOnyx.jpeg" alt="Stone example">
            <h2>Stone Chess Sets</h2>
            <p>	Our stone sets are made from finely polished Marble and 
            Onyx. The Marble is sourced from Vermont USA. The polished Marble
            makes an excellent touch on the white pieces and squares of the
            board. The Onyx we use in these sets is imported from Canada. The
            Marble and Onyx is a personal favorite of ours at Think-A-Head
            games. For our special customers we will substitute the Marble White
            squares and pieces for green jade.</p>
            <img src="4000-images/ivory.jpeg" alt="Ivory example">
            <h2>Ivory Chess Sets</h2>
            <p>	Although the selling of elephant Ivory was not banned until mid
            2016, We at Think-A-Head games discontinued the Ivory Chess set 
            creation line back in 2010 because we felt that the sourcing of said
            ivory was inhumane. If it is an Ivory chess set what you truly
            desire, then you are welcome to take your business elsewhere.</p>
