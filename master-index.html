                different counties of Florida to improve their roadways.

                <p>I was in charge of opening and closing the store. Also counting the registers.
                I was also in charge of making sure that I and my coworkers were being productive.
	                There were several take aways from this job. Most importantly experience in leadership.
            Also there was experience with Poin of sale systems and inventory databases.</p>

		<h1>My Portfolio</h1>
				<ol>
					<li><h3><a href="4000-home.html" class="button">Think-A-Head Games</a></h3></li>
					<p><a href="4000-home.html" class="button"><img src="images/chess.png"  alt="chesslogo"></a> </p>
					<ul>THINK-A-HEAD GAMES is my creation for a class in college.
					It is a fake company and website. Complete with an order form.
					For the final project for this class we had to make a website
					for a company (real or made-up). I decided to make-up a company 
					that makes handmade chess sets. I worked every day on this project
					for almost a month before I thought it was ready.</ul>
					<p></p>
					
					<li><h3><a href="p12-index.html" class="button">Social Media Overview</a></h3></li>
					<p><a href="p12-index.html" class="button"><img src="images/socialmediapro.png" alt="Social Media"></a></p>
					<ul>This is a Website I created to give a brief history of social media. 
					It was made with JQUERY. This was one of the last projects in the class.
					The assignment was to build a website from the ground up. Apple Dreamweaver
					was not used to make this website. I had to hard-code everthing into this website.
					While it is not my most recent website, I still dedicated a lot of my free time
					to working on this website.</ul>
					<p></p>
					
					<li><h3><a href="movie-index.html" class="button">Seminole Movie</a></h3></li>
					<p><a href="movie-index.html" class="button"><img src="images/seminole_movie.png" alt="Seminole Movie Connection"></a></p>
					<ul>This is a website I made with Ajax to access a movie database.
					It is a fully functional movie search engine. It can be used to search any 
					movie that has been released. I had to build this website from the ground
					up.</ul>
					<p></p>
					
					<li><a href="brownie-index2.html" class="button"><h3>Brownie Recipe</h3></a></li>
					<p><a href="brownie-index2.html" class="button"><img src="images/brownie.png" alt="Brownie"></a></p>
					<ul>-	This is an online recipe display app I created.
					It utilizes JavaScript to use drop down Ingredients
					list and Instructions. I was given less than a week to hard-code 
					the entire thing.</ul>
					<p></p>
